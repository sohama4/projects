To generate graphs, from root folder 3
./run

The graphs for each experiment will be generated in its respective directory (.jpg)
The values used to plot the graphs are stored as *.dat in the respective directories with the proper names

Approach:

1. Implement the given topology with oTcl and ns2
2. Vary the CBR inputs to the tcl files for the different variants required
3. The simulation will generate a .tr file for each input
4. Parse each .tr file to recover the parameters to calculate throughput, dropcount and latency using the respective awk scripts
5. Store the results of the parsing in .dat file
6. Used GNUPlot to generate graphs using the .dat file
